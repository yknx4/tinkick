# Tinkick

Searchkick-style search for Ruby and Rails, backed by
[PlanetScale TIN](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/search). Your model's
PostgreSQL table is the datasource. PostgreSQL maintains the search indexes when
rows change; there is no second document store to synchronize.

**Status: alpha.** The implemented API covers model registration, lazy search
relations, word and phrase queries, distance-one typo matching, scalar filters,
ordering, model/raw-row results, and pagination. This is a compatibility project,
not yet a complete drop-in replacement. This guide covers the feature surface of
the [Searchkick 6.1.2 reference README](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick/blob/93e901a75b11a25101668a616e006b158251b16e/README.md),
including features that still need an adapter or a different application design.

Throughout this guide:

- **Available** means implemented in Tinkick. Examples without another label use
  the current API.
- **Not implemented** means the Searchkick option or return interface is missing
  from Tinkick. It does not mean PostgreSQL or TIN cannot do it.
- **Excluded** means an Elasticsearch/OpenSearch transport, document import, or
  index lifecycle API has no direct role in this backend.
- **Native difference** identifies a documented or tested engine behavior.
- **Recipe** means application-owned SQL or ActiveRecord code, with its own
  return shape and behavior. A recipe is not a compatible Tinkick API.

## Requirements and installation

- Ruby **4.0+**.
- Rails / ActiveRecord **8.0+**, using the PostgreSQL adapter.
- PostgreSQL with the **TIN extension available on the server**. A standard local
  PostgreSQL installation does not include TIN.
- Searchable columns of type `text` or `citext`, with one TIN index per column.

ActiveRecord and `pg` are runtime dependencies. Rails is used for integration and
migration generators; Elasticsearch and OpenSearch clients are not required.
The version ranges permit future Ruby and Rails releases but do not claim they
have already been tested. The CI matrix targets Ruby 4.0 with Rails 8.0 and 8.1.

For a local checkout, add:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "tinkick", path: "../tinkick"
```

Then run `bundle install`. The repository can also build an installable gem with
`bundle exec rake build`; publication to RubyGems is a separate release step.

**Rails 8.0 compatibility:** add `gem "json", "< 3"` to the application Gemfile.
The verified Rails 8.0 encoder passes an option removed by JSON 3. The development
matrix pairs Rails 8.0 with JSON 2 and Rails 8.1 with JSON 3. Tinkick does not patch
Rails or impose the older JSON version on Rails 8.1 applications.

## Getting started

Enable the extension through a Rails migration:

```sh
bin/rails generate tinkick:install
bin/rails db:migrate
```

For existing `text` columns, generate the indexes:

```sh
bin/rails generate tinkick:index products name description
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Declare the model:

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  tinkick searchable: [:name, :description], default_fields: [:name]
end
```

Search existing records immediately after the migrations:

```ruby
products = Product.search("apple").where(in_stock: true).limit(20)
products.each { |product| puts product.name }

Product.search("red apple", fields: [:name], misspellings: false)
Product.search("*").order(name: :asc).limit(20)
```

`name`, `description`, and `in_stock` in these examples must be real columns.
Do not call `reindex`: the table is already the source of searchable records.
Model declaration does not connect to PostgreSQL or change the schema. The first
search validates the extension, fields, and usable indexes; missing schema
produces migration guidance.

## Migrating alongside Searchkick

Both gems can remain installed while you compare results:

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  searchkick searchable: [:name]
  tinkick searchable: [:name]
end

Product.searchkick_search("coffee") # Existing Searchkick backend
Product.tinkick_search("coffee")    # PostgreSQL/TIN backend
```

`tinkick_search` is always explicit. Tinkick installs `search` only if the model
does not already respond to that name, including inherited or nonpublic methods.
Searchkick can install its own alias when declared later, so use the explicit
methods during a transition. Tinkick does not define a `Searchkick` constant,
replace `searchkick`, or share the other gem's configuration.

Audit the features below before changing callers. Existing Searchkick callbacks,
queues, Redis dependencies, and reindex jobs still belong to Searchkick; retire
them when the old backend is no longer needed. See the
[transition guide](docs/migrating-from-searchkick.md) and
[compatibility inventory](docs/compatibility.md).

## Datasource and migrations

### `search_data` is a schema check

Tinkick calls `search_data` on a **new, unsaved model instance** and checks that
its keys are column names. It never serializes the returned values or copies
them to another index.

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  tinkick searchable: [:display_name]

  def search_data
    { display_name: self[:display_name], in_stock: self[:in_stock] }
  end
end
```

Every key must exist, including fields used only for filtering. A value calculated
by Ruby does not override its stored column. A missing column raises an error
instructing you to add a migration. Methods that require a saved ID, an associated
record, or existing rows must be changed to run safely on a new instance.
Without `search_data`, the model's columns supply the field inventory.

### Computed fields and generated columns

For a same-row expression, a stored generated column can replace computed
`search_data` and provide one combined searchable field:

```ruby
class AddDisplayNameToProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    add_column :products, :display_name, :virtual,
      type: :text,
      as: "coalesce(name, '') || ' ' || coalesce(description, '')",
      stored: true

    add_index :products, :display_name, using: :tin,
      name: "products_display_name_tin"
  end
end
```

Use an ordinary persisted column when the value needs Ruby logic, associations,
or other rows; your application must maintain that value. PostgreSQL generated
expressions must use immutable functions and cannot contain subqueries or read
other rows. See [generated columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html).

A combined field changes matching semantics: words can match across the original
columns, and phrases can cross their join boundary. Choose that behavior
explicitly instead of treating combination as a transparent index optimization.

### Generator behavior

`tinkick:install` generates extension enablement, not server software installation.
Its rollback refuses to remove a shared extension. Re-running the generator
preserves existing or edited installation migrations.

`tinkick:index TABLE FIELD...` adds separate reversible indexes for existing
columns. It does not create columns, infer Ruby methods, or accept expressions
and schema-qualified names. Duplicate fields and invalid identifiers are rejected.
Review generated migrations through the application's normal deployment process.
For custom names or specialized indexes, write an application Rails migration.
The current model API requires valid, ready, nonpartial, direct-column TIN indexes.

## Querying

Both keyword options and the implemented fluent modifiers are available:

```ruby
Product.search("apple", fields: [:name], where: { in_stock: true }, limit: 10)
Product.search("apple", fields: [:name]).where(in_stock: true).limit(10)
Product.search("apple", fields: [:name]).operator("or").misspellings(false)
```

The default query is `"*"`, the default operator is `"and"`, misspellings are
on, and the default limit is **10,000**. Set a smaller limit for user-facing pages.
Empty or punctuation-only text matches no records. Only a standalone `*` means
match all. Ordinary search text is treated literally rather than as raw TINQL;
quotes, `OR`, wildcard characters, and SQL fragments do not inject operators.

### Fields

Field selection precedence is: the search call's `fields`, model `default_fields`,
model `searchable`, then eligible `text`/`citext` columns from the datasource.
Selected fields need TIN indexes; filtering columns do not.

```ruby
Product.search("apple", fields: [:name])
Product.search("apple", fields: [:name]).fields(:description)
```

The fluent `fields` method **appends** fields. Use the keyword form to replace the
model's defaults. Per-field match hashes, boosted names such as `"name^5"`, nested
paths, and wildcard field names are not implemented.

### Laziness and modifiers

A `Tinkick::Relation` defers record retrieval until enumeration or loading. Model
schema validation may execute metadata queries when creating the search.

```ruby
base = Product.search("apple", fields: [:name])
filtered = base.where(in_stock: true) # Independent clone
filtered.load                       # Executes and returns the relation
filtered.loaded?                    # true
filtered.first                      # A model or nil
base.first(3)                       # Retrieves a bounded clone
```

Non-bang modifiers clone; their bang counterparts mutate an unloaded relation
and reject mutation after loading. Repeated `where` calls combine constraints;
`rewhere` replaces them. `order` appends sort terms; `reorder` replaces them.
`clone` and `dup` produce independent, unloaded relations.

### Ordering and projection

The default is native relevance descending. Explicit ordering accepts real
column names and `asc`/`desc` directions:

```ruby
Product.search("apple").order(price: :asc, id: :asc)
Product.search("apple").order(:name).reorder(created_at: :desc)
```

`order(_score: :desc)`, arbitrary SQL sort expressions, Elasticsearch missing-value
rules, and nested sorts are not implemented. Leave `order` unset for relevance.
`select`, `reselect`, `only`, `except`, and source-filtering options are not yet
part of the compatible relation API. `map(&:name)` reads the loaded page; it is
not a database projection. For a narrow SQL projection, use an explicitly
constructed ActiveRecord query as shown under [advanced SQL](#advanced-sql-and-debugging).

## Results and metadata

By default, results are actual ActiveRecord model instances selected from the
search query. Tinkick does not fetch external document IDs and then perform a
second database lookup.

```ruby
results = Product.search("apple").limit(20)
results.each { |product| puts product.name }
results.to_a
results[0]
results.first
results.size
results.any?
results.empty?
results.with_score.each { |product, score| puts [product.name, score] }
```

`size`, `length`, Enumerable `count`, `slice`, and array access describe the loaded
page. Use `total_count` or `total_entries` for the complete filtered result count;
that runs SQL without instantiating every matching record. The count is not capped
at the default 10,000-row retrieval limit.

Available pagination metadata includes `current_page`, `per_page`/`limit_value`,
`padding`, `total_pages`/`num_pages`, `offset_value`/`offset`,
`previous_page`/`prev_page`, `next_page`, `first_page?`, `last_page?`, and
`out_of_range?`. Supplying `total_entries:` overrides the reported total when the
application already knows it; an inaccurate override gives inaccurate page metadata.

### Legacy raw-row results

```ruby
results = Product.search("apple", load: false)
results = Product.search("apple").load(false)
row = results.first
row.name
row["name"]
```

This returns `Tinkick::HashWrapper` objects over database values and logs a
migration warning. Prefer normal model results. Both modes use PostgreSQL through
ActiveRecord; `load: false` is **not** a performance recommendation or an external
`_source` document. `load` without an argument executes the relation; it is
different from `load(false)`.

### Metadata still missing

`took`, `response`, `hits`, `with_hit`, `each_with_hit`, `with_details`, `error`,
`missing_records`, `model_name`, `entry_name`, `misspellings?`, suggestions,
aggregation metadata, and public highlight result methods are not implemented.
Do not expect Elasticsearch `_index`, `_shards`, `_source`, scroll IDs, or JSON
response envelopes. Use ActiveRecord instrumentation for timing and explicitly
serialize the visible records for an HTTP response.

## Filtering

Filters use real columns and bound values. These scalar forms are available:

| Operation | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Equality / NULL | `where(store_id: 1)`, `where(deleted_at: nil)` |
| Inequality | `where.not(store_id: 2)` |
| IN / NOT IN | `where(store_id: [1, 2])`, `where.not(store_id: [1, 2])` |
| Explicit IN / NOT | `where(store_id: { in: [1, 2] })`, `where(store_id: { not: 2 })` |
| Comparison | `where(price: { gt: 10, lte: 50 })` |
| Inclusive / exclusive range | `where(price: 10..50)`, `where(price: 10...50)` |
| Open-ended range | `where(created_at: 1.week.ago..)`, `where(price: ..50)` |
| Existence | `where(deleted_at: { exists: false })` |
| LIKE / ILIKE | `where(name: { like: "App%" })`, `where(name: { ilike: "%apple%" })` |
| Literal field prefix | `where(name: { prefix: "Apple" })` |
| Boolean OR | `where(_or: [{ in_stock: true }, { backordered: true }])` |
| Boolean AND / negation | `where(_and: [{ price: { gt: 10 } }, { price: { lt: 50 } }])`, `where(_not: { store_id: 2 })` |
| Legacy grouped OR | `where(or: [[{ store_id: 1 }, { store_id: 2 }]])` |

Negation includes SQL NULL values where the corresponding positive condition is
not true. `_not` negates each supplied field predicate, following the implemented
Searchkick contract; use explicit `_and`/`_or` grouping for complex expressions.
`exists` tests NULL, not whether a column name exists. Missing columns raise an
error. LIKE `%` and `_` are wildcards; use escaped patterns for literal characters.
Prefix filtering operates on the whole column, not individual search tokens.

The `all` operator is accepted on scalar columns as a conjunction of equalities;
a scalar cannot equal two distinct values. **PostgreSQL array and JSON columns
are currently rejected**, including array containment and nested matching. Ruby
Regexp filters, a `regexp` operator, and geospatial filter hashes are also missing.

Recipe alternatives, returning ordinary ActiveRecord relations:

```ruby
Product.where("tags @> ARRAY[?]::text[]", ["fruit", "fresh"])
Product.where("metadata @> ?::jsonb", { origin: "local" }.to_json)
Product.where("name ~ ?", "^Apple [[:alpha:]]+$")
```

These require the shown column types and appropriate indexes. PostgreSQL regex
syntax is not Ruby regex syntax; translate and test patterns rather than passing
arbitrary Ruby regex objects through. See [PostgreSQL pattern matching](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html).

## Pagination and large result sets

### Page and offset compatibility

```ruby
results = Product.search("apple").page(2).per_page(20)
results = Product.search("apple", page: 2, per_page: 20, padding: 3)
results = Product.search("apple").limit(20).offset(40)
```

`per` aliases `per_page`. `limit` takes precedence over `per_page`; an explicit
`offset` takes precedence over calculated page/padding offsets for retrieval.
Regular `next_page`/`total_pages` use the total count. The basic metadata is
implemented, but Kaminari and will_paginate view helpers have not been verified
as complete integrations; do not assume every helper-specific method exists.

Nonzero offsets can bypass TIN's top-k plan and sort matching rows. Tinkick logs
a warning when fetching such a ranked page. Deep paging is not protected by
Elasticsearch's 10,000-result window; the default limit is a retrieval default,
not an invitation to scan arbitrarily large pages.

### Countless pagination: opt in

```ruby
page = Product.search("apple", limit: 20, countless: true)
page.to_a
page.has_next_page?
page.next_page
```

Or call `.countless` on an unloaded relation. This fetches at most one extra row
to answer whether another page exists, without an automatic count. Relevance
ordering remains available. Calling `total_count` or `total_pages` still explicitly
requests the count. Countless pagination does not remove offset costs on later
numbered pages. A positive limit is required.

### Keyset pagination: opt in

```ruby
first = Product.search("apple", order: { id: :asc }, limit: 20, keyset: true)
cursor = first.next_cursor
second = Product.search("apple", order: { id: :asc }, limit: 20,
  keyset: true, after: cursor) if cursor
```

The fluent equivalent is `.keyset(after: cursor)`. Keyset pagination uses stable
column order rather than relevance and implies countless behavior. With no order,
it uses the primary key ascending; otherwise it appends the single primary key
as a tiebreaker unless already present. Use `has_next_page?` and `next_cursor`,
not `next_page`. Do not request another page when the cursor is nil.

Order columns must be nonnullable supported scalars: integer, text/citext/string,
UUID, date, timestamp, or decimal. Nullable columns, score ordering, repeated
columns, composite primary keys, offset, page greater than one, and padding are
rejected. Add appropriate ordinary indexes for the chosen order; arbitrary
column sorts are not promised TIN top-k performance.

A cursor is an encoded position, not a signature, authorization token, or
snapshot. Reapply the same query, order, filters, and tenant restrictions on every
request. Concurrent changes to sort values can affect traversal. Explicit totals
count the full filtered search, not just rows after the cursor.

### Scroll and exports

Searchkick's `scroll`, `scroll_id`, and `clear_scroll` are excluded backend cursor
APIs. For application exports, use a bounded keyset loop, or build an ordinary
ActiveRecord SQL scope and use [Rails batch APIs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Batches.html).
Batches do not preserve relevance order or create a stable snapshot automatically.
`deep_paging` and `body_options(track_total_hits: true)` are not required for an
explicit SQL total, and are not accepted Tinkick options.

## Models, scopes, and tenancy

### Default scopes, associations, and inheritance

Search queries start from the model's ActiveRecord scope, including default
scopes. Registration is inherited by subclasses. Searchkick's `inheritance:` and
query `type` options are not implemented; STI-specific behavior still needs its
own compatibility coverage rather than an assertion that all inheritance cases
are equivalent.

Call search on the model, not an ActiveRecord relation or association:

```ruby
Product.search("apple", where: { store_id: store.id })
```

`store.products.search(...)` and `Product.where(...).search(...)` are rejected.
`includes`, `model_includes`, and `scope_results` are not implemented on Tinkick
relations. For eager loading, construct a bounded ActiveRecord search scope and
use its normal association loading; do not preload every matching row merely to
paginate it.

### Multiple models and multi-search

Global `Tinkick.search`, `models`, `indices_boost`, and `Tinkick.multi_search` are
not implemented. Query each model explicitly, or design a SQL `UNION ALL` over
compatible projected columns. Combining independently ranked lists requires a
ranking policy; concatenating them is not a global relevance ranking. Batched
error handling is also an application concern, especially inside transactions.

### Tenants and nested data

Searchkick index names, prefixes, suffixes, and routing do not isolate PostgreSQL
rows. Pass a tenant filter on every query or use an application database/schema
routing design. [PostgreSQL row security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html)
can provide another boundary where correctly configured; Tinkick does not install
policies or verify an Apartment integration.

Nested paths such as `store.city`, nested-object filters, and JSON search field
mapping are not implemented. TIN supports text expression indexes, but the current
model API requires direct columns. A generated text column can expose a same-row
JSON property, or application SQL can use a matching expression index. Flattening
an array of objects loses nested-object correlation; use `EXISTS`/joins or JSON
predicates when that distinction matters.

## Indexing and synchronization

There is no `Product.reindex`, record/association reindex, import scope,
`search_document_id`, document removal call, refresh call, or index promotion
pipeline. SQL writes update the underlying table and its indexes together:

```ruby
product.update!(name: "Green Apple")
Product.search("green apple", misspellings: false)
```

Normal transaction visibility applies. Rolled-back writes do not remain
searchable. A read replica can still lag the writer.

| Searchkick facility | Tinkick replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `search_import`, eager import scopes, batch size, resume | No document import. Backfill newly persisted columns with application migrations/jobs. |
| Inline, async, queued, manual callbacks; bulk callback blocks | No synchronization callbacks. Use ordinary SQL/ActiveRecord writes. |
| `callbacks`, `callback_options`, conditional reindex predicates | Not accepted; maintain the actual source columns when application data changes. |
| `should_index?` | Express record eligibility as SQL filters/scopes; Ruby predicates are not translated. |
| Partial reindex / `ignore_missing` | Update the relevant columns; use ordinary record-not-found/update semantics. |
| Reindex queues, queue length, job options/priority, parent job, Redis status | No search synchronization jobs or Redis requirement. Application data-maintenance jobs remain your own. |
| Parallel reindex, refresh interval, wait, promote, clean old indices | Explicit PostgreSQL index DDL and operational maintenance, not document copying. |
| `reindex(import: false)` | Create the TIN index with a Rails migration. |
| `rake searchkick:reindex:all` | Apply required Rails schema migrations. |

Changing an association does not magically update a denormalized column on another
row. Maintain that column in a transaction, callback, job, or designed database
mechanism. Existing application business callbacks still run normally; only the
extra search-document synchronization layer is absent.

Physical TIN index rebuilding still exists. It may be required when analysis
settings change or as an operational action. That is distinct from Searchkick's
Ruby document reindexing. Use reviewed Rails migrations/maintenance procedures;
TIN documents concurrent creation and rebuilding in its
[index reference](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/search/reference/indexes).

## Advanced SQL and debugging

Elasticsearch/OpenSearch `body`, `body_options`, body-mutating blocks, mappings,
`merge_mappings`, Painless scripts, `request_params`, and client DSL calls are
excluded. Tinkick has no `Searchkick.client` substitute. Use the application's
ActiveRecord connection for deliberate native SQL.

Recipe for a trusted TINQL query with selected columns:

```ruby
Product.where("name ==> ?", 'apple AND NOT "apple pie"')
  .select("products.id, products.name, tin.score(products.ctid) AS score")
  .order(Arel.sql("score DESC")).limit(20)
```

These return ActiveRecord projections, not `Tinkick::Relation` metadata. Missing
projected attributes remain missing. TINQL supports proximity, spans, regex,
wildcards, term ranges, minimum-match groups, and boosts beyond the current public
compiler. Consult [TINQL](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/search/tinql),
[operator behavior](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/search/reference/operator),
and [supported SQL shapes](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/search/reference/sql-shapes).
Keep identifiers application-controlled and bind values. SQL binding alone does
not escape TINQL metacharacters.

### Inspect analysis, score terms, and plans

Searchkick's `debug`, `explain`, `search_index.tokens`, and raw `response` methods
are not implemented. Recipe queries can inspect the native engine:

```sql
SELECT tin.tokenize('Jalapeño Wi-Fi')
FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'tin';

SELECT (tin.score_inspect('products_name_tin'::regclass, 'apple', 2)).*
FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'tin';

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT id, tin.score(ctid) AS score
FROM products
WHERE name ==> 'apple'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Use the actual index name. `score_inspect` reports scored terms, not all matching
terms under every stopword setting. The catalog source is intentional: the tested
PlanetScale router rejects some standalone helper/SRF SQL shapes. Inspect the
query actually executed rather than assuming every PostgreSQL expression works
through the router. See [native functions](https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/search/reference/functions).

Use `sql.active_record` notifications and your Rails logger for timing and query
counts. Searchkick-specific Lograge `searchkick_runtime`, `opaque_id`, and profiling
response hooks are not supplied.
