## Testing

Use a real PostgreSQL database with TIN. Do not mock PostgreSQL, TIN, or
ActiveRecord to claim search compatibility. For an application with migrated
search columns and fixtures:

```ruby
class ProductSearchTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "search sees the current database row" do
    product = Product.create!(name: "Red Apple", description: "Fresh fruit")
    assert_includes Product.search("red apple", misspellings: false).map(&:id), product.id
  end
end
```

No search callback switch, `refresh`, or reindex trait is needed. Rails fixture
transactions provide test isolation. For Minitest outside Rails or RSpec, set up
the real connection/schema and transaction cleanup explicitly. Factory Bot creates
ordinary rows; do not add Searchkick-style reindex callbacks to its factories.
Parallel workers need separate databases or another verified isolation strategy,
not Searchkick index suffixes on one shared table.

### The repository's real Rails application

The [dummy application](../../test/dummy) serves HTML and JSON through a controller and
registered Tinkick models. Its fixture set includes 64 deterministic synthetic
Tolkien characters generated with `Faker::Fantasy::Tolkien` and a separate
268-document search corpus: 256 varied multi-sentence records plus 12 controls
for phrase order, term frequency, document length, field boundaries, and typos.
These are synthetic test records, not assertions about Tolkien's canon.

```sh
direnv exec . bundle exec ruby -Itest test/rails_app_test.rb --fail-fast
```

The HTTP tests exercise real stored values, rendered and JSON output, filters,
bounded pages, injection-like search text, native typo matching, and visibility after
writes, plus countless navigation and cursor traversal. The development matrix
uses Ruby 4.0.1, Rails 8.0.5.1 and 8.1.3.1, with JSON 2.21.2. Remote CI has not
been run. See the tests and [development guide](../../docs/development.md) for current
verification commands.

A separate fixed **10,000-document** corpus uses Faker Tolkien seed 314159,
9,992 varied documents across fantasy/travel/food/technical topics, and eight
explicit controls. Its stress test passed **26 assertions** covering ranking,
unrelated text, phrases, typos, facets, keyset/countless pagination, and updates:

```sh
direnv exec . bundle exec ruby -Itest test/stress_test.rb --fail-fast
```

[Executed stress query plans](../../docs/query-plans.md#fixed-10000-document-corpus)
show TIN top-k for relevance/countless queries, a primary-key scan for the
match-all cursor case, and SQL aggregation over the complete corpus. These are
local regression and execution-plan results, not complete Searchkick parity or
production throughput claims.

### CI and database isolation

Repository tests use `tinkick_test`; development uses `tinkick_development`.
Standard PostgreSQL environment variables come from direnv locally. The harness
checks `current_database()` before Rails migrations, uses test-owned table names,
and requires TIN or Lead installed on the server. Keep `.envrc` and `dev.ejson`
unchanged. Separate fixture processes must not share the same test database.

Each CI matrix job runs an isolated PostgreSQL 18.6 server with
[PlanetScale Lead](https://github.com/planetscale/lead), without PlanetScale
secrets; the jobs can run in parallel. GitHub uses Docker/Buildx, while local
reproduction uses Apple's `container` tool. PostgreSQL comes from a pinned
prebuilt image. Intermediate Rust/Lead layers use the GitHub Actions cache with
`mode=max`; a warm local build reported all layers `CACHED`.

Exactly 31 observed failing tests are temporarily excluded on Lead
pending upstream fixes. Production-only plan assertions are gated separately;
both remain active against PlanetScale TIN. See [Lead CI](../../docs/lead-ci.md) for
the limitations and reproduction steps, and [the workflow](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
for configuration. This is not a claim that remote CI has completed.

## Development, upgrades, and contributing

Keep the existing `.envrc` and `dev.ejson` local. They supply development/test
connection settings, are excluded from Git and the gem, and must not be replaced
or printed during setup. Requiring the gem and unit/boot checks do not require a
live database; integration tests do.

```sh
direnv exec . bundle install
direnv exec . bundle exec rbs collection install
direnv exec . bundle exec rubocop -A Gemfile tinkick.gemspec Rakefile Steepfile lib test
direnv exec . bundle exec rake rbs:format rbs:quality
direnv exec . bundle exec rake
direnv exec . bundle exec rake build
```

`rake` runs the combined fail-fast Minitest suite, RuboCop, RBS validation, and
Steep. `rake build` produces `pkg/tinkick-0.1.0.alpha.1.gem`. `Gemfile.lock` is local
and ignored so supported dependency ranges can be exercised. CI uses Bundler
directly rather than a local `.envrc`.

Contributions should pair behavior changes with meaningful tests against real
TIN, keep RBS and RuboCop synchronized, and use reviewable Conventional Commits.
Report the Ruby/Rails/PostgreSQL/TIN versions, reproducible query, schema, and
actual plan when reporting a search bug; omit credentials and private records.

Upgrading from Searchkick 5 or 6 is a backend migration, not merely a gem version
change. Audit model options, derived fields, query methods, result consumers,
background jobs, and relevance expectations. The supported keyword/fluent APIs
cover part of Searchkick 6's builder interface. Migrate conversion columns with
Rails and select v2 explicitly as described above; Searchkick's index upgrade
tasks are not Tinkick procedures. Follow
[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for Tinkick changes and rerun application search
contracts before upgrading an alpha release.

Thanks to the Searchkick project for the API this gem aims to preserve, and to
the PlanetScale TIN team for the PostgreSQL search engine and reference material.
